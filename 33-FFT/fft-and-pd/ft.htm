2. Fourier-Transformation</h2>
</blockquote>
Of the various forms of Fourier-Transformations I will mainly talk about the
Discrete (dealing with digitized signals) Real Fourier-Transformation (only
sometimes, however, about the Complex DFT), and additionally, - for reasons of
calculation-time - about the Fast Fourier-Transformation or simply the FFT.
<p>
<br>The Fourier-Transformation is a mathematical function that breaks down a
signal (like sound) into its frequency-spectrum as a set of sinusoidal
components, converting it from the Time Domain to the Frequency Domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the Time Domain the signal x[ ] consists of N samples, labeled
  from 0 to N-1. In the Frequency Domain the RFFT produces two signals (signalvectors),
  treated as complex numbers representing the Real Part: Re X[ ] and the
  Imaginary Part: Im X[ ]. They are seen as the Cosine- und Sine-Components of
  the base frequencies. Each of these two signals contains one more sample than
  the half of the original signal: N/2
+ 1 samples. (this results from the fact, that the sine-components of the first
  frequency (0) and the last (nyquist, N/2) are always 0). With the complex Fourier-Transformation
  N complexe values are transformed to N new complex values. For both it applies
  to: the Frequency Domain contains exactly the same information as the
  Time-Domain.

<br>&nbsp;<p>A Real FFT over 64 samples produces values for 33 cosine- and 33 sine-wave-amplitudes
with the frequencies 0, 1, 2, 3,
..., 30, 31, 32. The first value (frequency 0) is the DC (direct current), the
other values have to be seen in practice as factors of a fundamental-frequency
which can be calculated by dividing samplerate by windowsize. The highest
frequency is the nyquist-frequency (samplerate/2).<p>&nbsp;
