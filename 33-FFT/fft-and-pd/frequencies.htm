<h2>7. &quot;Frequencies Between&quot;</h2>
</blockquote>

<p><br>&quot;Frequencies Between&quot; I call those frequencies, which are no
base frequencies. They are not represented by integers and do not
&quot;fit&quot; into the FFT-Window. Their phase is changing over time.<p>In the
following case the frequency is somewhat more than eight cycles per window. On
the right side you can see the corresponding phase-values. The phase-value
measures the difference to the cosine-wave in its initial state. On the one hand
you can see the phases shifting slowly, on the other hand you will recognize,
that phases of neighbouring channels are rotated by 180° (paraphase).
Nevertheless all phases occurring in those channels are moving (nearly)
synchronously - indepentent of the size of the amplitude.<p>The phase shifting
of a single steady frequency runs linear. But even at such ideal conditions this
linearity is destroyed as soon as a second wave apperas, as because two
frequencies close to each other having influence on the same frequency channel.
There is no solution for this problem, only compromise-methods. In the simpliest
case you assume that the phase of each channel continues linear, as it is done
in a phase vocoder.<p>Here, in these special figures I edited out all
phase-values of amplitudes which are (negligibly) small! (Fig. 19).<p>

<br>&nbsp;<p>Besides the correct handling of pitch, it is also important to
obtain stepless connections of two windows. This is a hard fight when changing
frequency-spectra to get no glitches (when will someone teach me the right word
for &quot;Knackser&quot;...?).
