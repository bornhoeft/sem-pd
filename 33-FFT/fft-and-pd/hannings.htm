6. Effects of Hanning-Windows</h2>

  <p><br>In most cases you will multiplicate a signal, which should be observed
  with a Hanning-Window. So you give it a fade in and a fade out. As discussed
  in the chapter &quot;Convolution&quot;, the result of the analysis is modified
  by this multiplication. Frequencies, exactly equal to a basefrequency, appear
  without windowing as a single sample, with the usage of the Hanning-Window the
  peak falls into three channels. With frequencies lying between base
  frequencies, you can see &quot;tails&quot; on the side without windowing, but
  these tails are reduced by the Hanning-Window. (Fig.17 and 18).

  <p>It is not fully obvious to me in some cases, why it is really necessary to
  use a Hanning-Window. Some calculations could be done without windowing. But
  in the majority of cases two overlapping FFTs are used, the second of them
  starting exactly at half of the period of the first. The Hanning Window
  manages the crossfading of the two FFTs. The timing of the second
  calculation-process is done automatically in Pd by the object
  &quot;block~&quot; when given the value 2 as second argument.
