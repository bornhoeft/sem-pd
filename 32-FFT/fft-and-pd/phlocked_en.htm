  When a signal is multiplicated by a Hinning-Window a frequency is present in
  more than one channel. In general the frequency-peak is spread over four
  channels, only if a frequency is a base frequency it covers three channels,
  where the amplitude in the middle is twice as big as the neighbours. [2], [4].
  For the resynthesis all values &gt; 0 are involved, and because phase changes
  in adjacent channels are not the same, there appear crosstalks of the phases.
  <p>By and by this error is getting bigger, and amplitude-modulations occur,
  noticeable in the so called &quot;reverberance&quot; of the phase vocoder.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So you come to the point, where you want to itroduce phase locking of
  adjacent channels. (This is all taken from Miller [2]). It is based on the
  assumption to calculate the phase change not only from one channel, but also
  from the two adjacent channels. Because phases of adjacent channels are (ideally)
  180° out of phase, you use the negatives of them. The phase of a sum of
  complex numbers is mainly effected by the strongest amplitude. So the adjacent
  channels adept their phase to the one of the main-component. The result sounds
  clearer than without phase locking.</p>
