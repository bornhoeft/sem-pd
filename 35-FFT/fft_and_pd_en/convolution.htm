5. Convolution</h2>

<p><br>One of the most frequent applications in the frequency domain is the
Convolution. If you tried to calculate it in the time domain, you would need a
multiple of arithmetic operations. In the frequency domain it is simply a
multiplication... This phenomenon appears also conversly: a multiplication in
the time domain causes a convolution in the frequency domain, which takes
influence
among other things on the use of Hanning(and other)-Windows. A consequence is
that each frequency-peak broadens by the windowing, which can have advantages,
but also disadvantages, read <a href="hannings.htm">&quot;Effects of
Hanning-Windows&quot;</a>.
<p>For an understanding of the Convolution of two signal you can think of the
reverberation of one signal by another. A large hall, like in a church,
influences every sound you produce, in fact at every time, at every pitch and
frequency range. It applies a kind of fade out tail to the signal. Technically
you can look at the reverb as a hall-sample, doing the following to all
frequencies: in the beginning loud, and then gradully fading out, which is -
white noise shaped by a simple envelope.</p>
<p>Wanting to calculate this mathematically, you would have one sample after the
other to multiplicate with each sample of the hallsignal/hallsample and finally
add all particular signals.&nbsp;<p>The same effect is reached by a
multiplication of the corresponding Frequencies in the frequency domain. You
merely have to pay attention to the correct handling of the complex numbers.
